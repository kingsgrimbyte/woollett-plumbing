From slow drains to sudden pipe bursts, small signs often point to larger issues. At <strong>Woollett Plumbing</strong>, we help homeowners spot problems early, perform effective temporary repairs, and know when to call a licensed plumber. Below we outline the top five plumbing problems in U.S. homes, what typically causes them, simple DIY steps you can take, and when to contact a professional.</p> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>1. Leaky Faucets and Fixtures: Drips That Add Up</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Leaky faucets are common and often start as a small drip. While a single drip may seem minor, it can waste thousands of gallons per year and increase your water bill. Common causes include worn washers, corroded valve seats, or loose parts.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2 '><p><strong>Quick Fix</strong>: Turn off the water supply, replace worn washers or O-rings, and tighten loose parts. For cartridge or ceramic-disc faucets, replacement cartridges are often available at hardware stores.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>When to Call a Pro</strong>: If the leak is inside the wall, coming from a pipe connection, or repeats after repairs, call a licensed plumber to check valve seats, supply lines, and potential hidden damage.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Fixing drips saves water and prevents long-term damage like wood rot, mold, and higher energy costs if the leak affects a hot-water line.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>2. Clogged Drains: Kitchen and Bathroom Blockages</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Clogged sinks and showers are among the top service calls for plumbers. Hair, grease, soap scum, food waste, and foreign objects are typical culprits. Left untreated, clogs can cause slow drainage, backups, and overflows.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Quick Fix</strong>: Use a plunger or a plumber's snake for minor clogs. For kitchen sinks, avoid pouring grease down the drain; instead, wipe pans and dispose of grease in the trash. Enzyme drain cleaners can help maintain organic buildup but avoid corrosive chemicals that can harm pipes.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>When to Call a Pro</strong>: If multiple fixtures back up simultaneously, there may be a main sewer line issue. Persistent clogs, recurring slow drains, or strong sewage smells require professional inspection and possibly hydro-jetting or sewer-line repair.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Install hair strainers in showers and regularly clean kitchen trap (P-trap) to prevent buildup.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>3. Running Toilets: Wasted Water and High Bills</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>A running toilet can waste dozens of gallons per hour. Most cases are caused by a faulty flapper, improper float height, or fill-valve issues.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Quick Fix</strong>: Inspect and replace the flapper, adjust the float, or replace the fill valve. These parts are inexpensive and commonly fix the problem.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>When to Call a Pro</strong>: If the toilet continues to run after replacing parts, or if you notice persistent phantom flushing or mineral buildup, a plumber can diagnose less obvious causes like cracked tanks or pressure issues.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Fixing a running toilet reduces water waste and lowers utility bills\u2014an easy, cost-effective conservation step for any household.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>4. Water Heater Problems: No Hot Water or Strange Noises</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Water heaters fail for many reasons: sediment buildup, faulty thermostats, leaking tanks, or failed heating elements. Electric and gas models have different failure modes, but both can leave you without hot water when you need it most.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Quick Fix</strong>: Check the pilot light on gas models, test/reset the thermostat, and drain the tank to remove sediment buildup. Regular flushing every 6\u201312 months prolongs tank life and maintains efficiency.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>When to Call a Pro</strong>: Leaks at the tank, discolored water, or continuous cycling are signs the unit may need professional repair or replacement. For gas water heaters, always call a licensed technician for gas connections and venting issues.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Energy Tip</strong>: Lowering the thermostat to 120\u00b0F and insulating hot-water pipes can reduce energy use while maintaining performance.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>5. Burst Pipes and Frozen Pipes: Emergencies to Address Immediately</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Burst or frozen pipes can cause catastrophic water damage. Freezing occurs when water in pipes expands; bursts can also happen from corrosion, high pressure, or accidental impact during renovations.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Immediate Steps</strong>: Shut off the main water supply, open faucets to drain remaining water, and apply heat to frozen sections (space heaters or warm towels). Avoid open flames.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>When to Call a Pro</strong>: Any active burst pipe or suspected hidden leak requires immediate professional attention to stop water flow, perform repairs, and assess water damage and mold risk.</p></li>     <li class='mb-2'><p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Insulate exposed pipes, maintain stable indoor temperatures during cold snaps, and disconnect outdoor hoses before winter.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>How to Decide When to DIY and When to Call Woollett Plumbing</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Small maintenance tasks\u2014like replacing a faucet cartridge, plunging a minor clog, or draining a water heater\u2014can be handled by many homeowners.
